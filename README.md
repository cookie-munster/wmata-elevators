# wmata-elevators

This webmap shows the location of elevators on the Washington DC Metro System.

Created because there is no map of elevators (only inidividual station maps), and I had a really hard time finding some of them!

It is simple, with a basic geolocation and no routing. This data will hopefully
make it into Google Maps. 

# Data Source:
DC Gov: http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/metro-station-entrances-regional
(data cleaned by removing entrances for stations. EX for a station that has 4 entrances and only 1 elevator / accessible entrance, only the accessible entrance is kept. Data taken June 2017)

# Disclaimer: *I'm assuming DC GIS put the elevators in the correct locations*
