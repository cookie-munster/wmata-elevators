# wmata-elevators

This webmap shows the location of elevators on the Washington DC Metro System.

Created because there is no map of elevators (only inidividual station maps), and I had a really hard time finding some of them!

It is simple, with a basic geolocation and no routing. This data will hopefully
make it into Google Maps shortly.
